## Guards and Prisoners Problem

### Description
- Three guard and three prisoners must cross river.
- Boat may take only one or two people at a time.
- Prisoners may never outnumber guards on either time (thought prisoner may be alone on either coast).
 
### Modeling using Semantic Nework 

**Lexicon**: Consider each node to be a unique state, represented by:
    - number of prisoners and guards on left side
    - number of prisoners and guards on right side
    - side that boat is on.

**Structure**: 

**Semantic**:
