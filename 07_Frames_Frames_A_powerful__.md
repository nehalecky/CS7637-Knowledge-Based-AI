## Framing a Sentence

Find the *action* in the sentence. The action dictates what slots the frame contains, and its keys and values.

### *Example*: Ashok ate a frog.


**Ate**

- subject :
- object : 
- location : 
- time : 
- utensils :
- object-alive : 
- object-is : 
- subject-mood :

### *Example*: David ate a pizza at home.


**Ate**

- subject : David 
- object : pizza
- location : home
- time : 
- utensils :
- object-alive : 
- object-is : in-subject
- subject-mood : happy


## Properties of Frames

- represent stereotypes (often cultural specific)
- provide default values
- exhibit inheritance (i.e., ala classes and instances)

### Relation to Semantic Networks

Create Frame for each object, the frame *slots* then contain the structure of the semantic network, lexically, structurally and semantically. 

#### Example

**Object**

- name : x
- shape : triangle
- size : large
- fill : false
- inside : 
- above :

**Object**

- name : z
- shape : circle
- size : large
- fill : false
- inside : 
- above : x

### Relation to Production Systems

## Frame relation to Human Cognition

1. Frames are a structured knowledge representation (in comparison with Procedural Rules). They can be considered molecules of knowledge to the atoms of knowledge that are representative in procedural rules.
2. Frames enable one to construct a theory of cognitive processing that isn't entirely bottom up, but partially top-down.
3. Frames capture the notion of stereotypes, which are a *cognitively-efficient* default value for the attributes of frames.
