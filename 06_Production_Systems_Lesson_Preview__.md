## Cognitive Agent

It's a mapping of *precepts* to an *action*, like:

$$ f(P^*) = A $$

### Levels of Cognitive Architectures

High level to Low level, like:

- Task / Knowledge Level
  (e.g., selecting a pitch, playing baseball)
- Algorithm / Symbol Level
  (e.g., means-end analysis, semantic networks)
- Hardware / Implementation Level
  (e.g., a brain, a transitor)

Higher level architectures provide *content* to be manipulated in lower levels. Lower levels provide *architecture* for implementing what is represented in higher level. 

*Example* Smart Phone: phone allows for communication with others at long distances

### Assumptions of Cognative Architecture

- Goal Oriented: take actions in pursuit of goals
- Rich, complex environment
- Significant knowledge: leverage knowledge to achieve goals.
- Symbols and abstractions
- Flexible and function of the environment: behavior is dependant on environment
- Learning: learn through interactions
- 

### Simple Equation

$$ Architecture + Content = Beahavior $$
