## Cognitive Agent

It's a mapping of *precepts* to an *action*, like:

$$ f(P^*) = A $$

### Levels of Cognitive Architectures

High level to Low level, higher level architectures provide *content* for lowers. Lower levels provide *architecture* for higher level. 

- Task / Knowledge Level
  (e.g., selecting a pitch, playing baseball)
- Algorithm / Symbol Level
  (e.g., means-end analysis, semantic networks)
- Hardware / Implementation Level
  (e.g., a brain, a transitor)
