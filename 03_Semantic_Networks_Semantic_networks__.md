# 03 - Semantic Networks

*Semantic networks* are a knowledge representation scheme. 

This lesson will cover the following topics:

- Knowlege representations
- Semantic networks
- Problem-solving with semantic networks
- Represent & Reason

## Representation

In each knowledge representation, there is a *language*, and that language has a *vocabulary*. In addition, the representation contains some *content* (or knowledge). 

### Example: Newton's 2nd Law of Motion

$$ F = ma $$
Force is equal to mass times acceleration

## Introduction to Semantic Networks

How to represent *Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices* using a semantic network.
State $A$, and state $B$.
1. Label all objects (`x` is a circle, `y` is the diamond, $$z$$ is the black dot), and reference them as nodes
2. Represent the relationships between nodes, in both states (frames), both $$A$$ and $$B$$.
3. Represent the transformation between the nodes between states, $$A$$ and $$B$$.
4.
