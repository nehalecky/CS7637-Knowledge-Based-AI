# 03 - Semantic Networks

*Semantic networks* are a knowledge representation scheme. 

This lesson will cover the following topics:

- Knowlege representations
- Semantic networks
- Problem-solving with semantic networks
- Represent & Reason

## Representation

In each knowledge representation, there is a *language*, and that language has a *vocabulary*. In addition, the representation contains some *content*(or knowledge). 

### Example: Newton's 2nd Law of Motion

$$ F = ma $$
Force is equal to mass times acceleration
