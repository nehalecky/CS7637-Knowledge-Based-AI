- k-Nearest Neighbor
- Cases in the real world

## In General, Recording Cases

Given a problem **a**, retrieve most similar prior problem, **b**, from memory.
Apply **b**'s solution to problem **a**.

- *Example*: tying one's shoes.
- *Example*: design patterns in programming. 
- *Example*: null exception, and stack tracing.

## Case Retrieval by Nearest Neighbor

Define some parameter set that can prescribe numerical values to each *case* (e.g., height and weight).

Given existing case at ($x_c$, $y_c$), and new problem at (x_n, y_n)

$$ d = \sqrt{(y_{c} - y_{n})^{2} + (x_{c} - x_{n})^{2}} $$
